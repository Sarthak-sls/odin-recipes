    <h3>"Description"</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </p>
    <p>There is a fresh version of lasagna that requires pre-boiling the pasta before filling it or adding sauce and then baking. There are also commercial versions, however, that allow for spreading the pasta in a baking pan and filling it or adding more liquid sauces so that the pasta softens during cooking. The sauces may be based on tomatoes and meat, cheese, pesto or even vegetables and béchamel. On top of it all, there is a layer of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and it is baked for a length of time that depends on the type of lasagna noodles used.  </p>
    <p>The tradition of lasagna originated in Emilia Romagna, and from there it has become one of the symbols of Italian cuisine throughout the world. Abroad, lasagne alla bolognese, made with béchamel and meat sauce, is well known. The Neapolitan version of this recipe includes among its ingredients tomato sauce, mozzarella, meatballs and Roman ricotta cheese. In Liguria, pesto is used as a sauce, while in Venice the sauce is replaced with red radicchio. The lasagna you eat depends on where you are. </p>
    <p>The industrially prepared lasagna can keep for about two weeks if tightly sealed and kept refrigerated. The handmade type should be eaten within two days. If already cooked and stuffed, the lasagna noodles can stay in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. To keep them longer, they can be frozen either with or without pre-cooking them. When frozen, they keep up to one month. </p>
